# MockMR

MockMR is a Python library for writing MapReduce jobs in an Educational setting. It is intended to be used as a conceptual teaching tool.

MockMR provides an interface for defining and running MapReduce locally. Simply define your map and reduce functions, input your data and call the run function. Everything is run sequentially and locally.

### Streaming Jobs

MockMR defines the MockStreamingJob class which expects the input to be a byte stream of characters.

The chunks of data are separated by newline ("\n") characters. Each line is sent to a separate map worker.

### Native Python Jobs

MockMR defines the MockPythonJob class which accepts a Python list as input. The elements of the list can be any type.

## Installation

    pip install mockmr

## Example Usage

    from mockmr.mockmr import MockPythonJob

    class MyJob(MockPythonJob):

        def map_fn(self, _, line):
            # Do a map process
            yield (mapped_key, mapped_value)

        def reduce_fn(self, key, values):
            # Do a reduction on values with key 
            yield (reduced_key, reduced_value)
    
    # Get some input
    input = ...
    
    # Create job object
    job = MyJob()
    
    # Run the job and collect the output
    results = job.run(input)
